            <h2>Stories</h2>
            <p>Fantasy stories in particular. I can't get enough of them, and it 
                doesn't matter what form they come in - movies, games or books. 
                When I was younger, I remember the moment when I realised that 
                I had run out of fantasy books to read. I had read all of the major 
                ones, from Wheel of Times to Game of Thrones, from Garth Nix to 
                Patrick Rothfuss. </p>

            <h2>Boxing</h2>
            <p>I love the sport of boxing, and I strongly believe that boxing training 
                is greatly beneficial for not just your physical health &#40;that goes without 
                saying&#41; but also your mental and spiritual well-being. There's good reason 
                why so many writers and philosophers have been taken with boxing.</p>

            <h2>People</h2>
            <p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn once wrote "The line between good and evil runs through every human heart". 
                I try to live my life following those words. When I meet people I assume that they have something 
                valuable to add and an important story to tell. Thus I try to treat everyone with the same respect 
                and I try to listen closely to what they have to say. Too sentimental for an About Me page? Probably, 
                but I don't think I'm capable of writing an About Me page without being a little sentimental.</p>
